//! A Rust board support package (BSP) for the Teensy 4. Supports the Teensy 4.0 and
//! 4.1 boards.
//!
//! Peripherals are re-exported from the [`imxrt-hal`](imxrt_hal)
//! hardware abstraction layer. See the HAL's documentation for more information on creating
//! and using peripherals.
//!
//! # Runtime
//!
//! The `teensy4-bsp` use the [`cortex-m-rt`] crate to provide a runtime. Enable runtime support using
//! the `"rt"` feature. To properly link your program, you **must link with the `t4link.x` linker
//! script**.
//!
//! [`cortex-m-rt`]: https://crates.io/crates/cortex-m-rt
//!
//! The `teensy4-bsp` emits a `cortex-m-rt`-compatible linker script. The layout supports the i.MX RT's boot requirements
//! and advanced memory features. Specifically, the layout includes the image vector table (IVT) and boot data
//! that's necessary for i.MX RT processors. Additionally, the layout specifies the FlexSPI configuration block's (FCB)
//! FLASH location. Finally, the linker script places all instructions in ITCM, and all data in DTCM.
//!
//! The `teensy4-bsp` provides its own reset hander. The custom reset handler
//!
//! - initalizes TCM regions
//! - copies instructions into ITCM
//! - copies the vector table into DTCM, and sets VTOR
//! - set's the CCM's low-power setting
//!
//! The reset handler then calls the `cortex-m-rt` entrypoint to finish memory initialization and invoke your program's
//! `main()`.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! The `teensy4-bsp` supports these features:
//!
//! | Flag            |         Description                                                   | Default? |
//! | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
//! | `"usb-logging"` | Adds support for logging over USB with the `log` crate                | âœ“        |
//! | `"rt"`          | Adds runtime support using `cortex-m-rt`                              |          |
//! | `"rtic"`        | Adds support for using the BSP peripherals with RTIC                  |          |
//!
//! Proper RTIC support requires that you disable the BSP's default features. You may combine `"rtic"` with
//! either `"rt"` and `"usb-logging"`.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies.teensy4-bsp]
//! default-features = false
//! features = ["rtic",  "rt"]
//! version = # ...
//! ```
//!
//! # Pins
//!
//! The BSP helps you convert all the i.MX RT processor pads into your Teensy 4's pins.
//! From these pins, you may construct peripherals and perform I/O. See the [`pins`] module
//! for more information.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Turn on a Teensy 4.0's LED:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use cortex_m::asm::wfi;
//! use teensy4_bsp as bsp;
//!
//! use embedded_hal::digital::v2::OutputPin;
//!
//! let peripherals = bsp::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//! let pins = bsp::pins::t40::from_pads(peripherals.iomuxc);
//! let mut led = bsp::configure_led(pins.p13);
//!
//! loop {
//!     led.set_high().unwrap();
//!     wfi();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See more examples in the project's repository.
